# Release your project

This section explains how to release a project based on `opentemplate`.

Release when:

- You are ready to share the project (publicly or privately).
- Pipelines and `pre-commit` checks have passed (tests, security, etc.).

> [!CAUTION]
> Create a GitHub tag on a release page; everything else is automated.

Start here:

- [Checklist](checklist.md) – steps to complete before release
- [Process](process.md) – how the release works
