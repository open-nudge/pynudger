# Governance

This document describes the roles and responsibilities of the maintainers.

## Decision process

- We welcome all contributors and maintainers,
    see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) on __any project-related topics__.
- _open-nudge_ reserves the right to make final
    decisions on the project (the roadmap, features, releases,
    general project direction and so on)

## Roles

- __External contributors__ - anyone who is not a maintainer (can submit PRs,
    issues, and so on)
- __Maintainers__ - people who have write access to the repository (can merge
    PRs, open/close issues and so on)
- __Specific roles__ (e.g. release manager, security leader) are under
    the discretion of _open-nudge_

## Questions

In case of specific questions, open a new discussion or contact one of the
maintainers directly.
